# Banking-Transaction_with-AI
End-to-end banking analytics project using SQL for data cleaning and Power BI for interactive dashboards, featuring AI-generated synthetic data and custom DAX KPIs.

SQL + Power BI Banking Dashboard with AI-driven DAX KPIs

# Banking Transactions Data Cleaning & Visualization  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project showcases an **end-to-end data analytics process** using **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **DAX** to transform raw, unclean synthetic banking data into meaningful insights.  

The dataset was generated using **Perplexity AI** and contains:  
- **10,000 dummy transactions**  
- **Customers** table  
- **Accounts** table  

The data was deliberately designed with **null values, errors, and duplicates** to mimic real-world banking data challenges.

## üîÑ Workflow Steps  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Generation  
- Created three relational tables:  
  - **Customers**: ID, personal details, demographics  
  - **Accounts**: Account details, type, balances  
  - **Transactions**: Transaction ID, account linkage, amount, type, date  
- Introduced missing data, duplicate records, and inconsistent formats.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preparation (SQL)  
- Removed duplicate rows.  
- Handled null values via deletion or imputation.  
- Corrected data types and formatting.  
- Enforced referential integrity between tables.  
- **Used `LEFT JOIN`** to merge **Customers**, **Accounts**, and **Transactions** tables ‚Äî ensuring all customer/account records were retained even if transactions were missing.  
- Created cleaned, analysis-ready tables for Power BI import.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization (Power BI)  
- Imported cleaned data into **Power BI**.  
- Created interactive dashboards to explore:  
  - Transaction trends  
  - Account balances  
  - Customer demographics  
- Applied **DAX measures** generated with AI for KPI tracking.

## üìä KPIs & DAX Measures  

| KPI | Description | Visual | DAX / Example |
|-----|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Transactions by Type | Count of transactions grouped by type | Pie Chart / Stacked Column | `COUNT(CombinedBankingDataset[TransactionID])` grouped by `TransactionType` |
| Monthly Transaction Amount | Total transaction amount by month | Line / Area Chart | `Monthly Transaction Amount = CALCULATE(SUM(CombinedBankingDataset[TransactionAmount]), MONTH(CombinedBankingDataset[TransactionDate]))` |
| Top N Customers by Transaction Value | Customers with the highest transaction values | Top N Bar Chart | Apply **Top N** filter on `CustomerName` by SUM(TransactionAmount) |
| Total Balance by Account Type | Total balance per account type | Clustered Bar | `Total Balance = SUM(CombinedBankingDataset[Balance])` grouped by `AccountType` |
| Monthly Transaction Balance by Month | Net balance trends across months | Line / Area Chart | `Monthly Transaction Balance = CALCULATE(SUM(CombinedBankingDataset[Balance]), MONTH(CombinedBankingDataset[TransactionDate]))` |
| Customer Count by Gender | Distribution of customers by gender | Donut Chart | `Customer Count = COUNTROWS(VALUES(CombinedBankingDataset[CustomerID]))` grouped by `Gender` |

## üìå Insights  

From the analysis:  
- Certain account types dominate the total balance share.  
- Monthly transaction volumes show seasonal fluctuations, with peaks in **June** and **December**.  
- A small number of customers contribute disproportionately to total transaction value.  
- Inactive accounts are clustered in specific months, potentially due to customer churn or inactivity.  
- Gender and age group distributions reveal concentrated demographics.

## üèÅ Conclusion  

This project highlights how **AI-generated synthetic data** can be used for **practical data analytics exercises**.  
It demonstrates:  
- **SQL proficiency**, including the use of **`LEFT JOIN`** for combining datasets while preserving all base records.  
- **Power BI dashboarding** for visual storytelling.  
- **DAX measure creation** for KPI insights.  

The workflow mirrors a real-world **ETL pipeline** ‚Äî from raw, messy data to interactive reports that inform decision-making.
